## this folder contains code for the 2022 NASA Space Apps Challenge. the purpose of this challenge was to
## create a platform to help the user learn more about stellar variabililty. 
## my teams goal was to create a webpage where the user could change metrics related to stellar variabillty that
## would then change an animated simulation of an exoplanet and star, and an animated line graph. 
## my part consisted of data filtration and exportation and creating the animated exoplanet. R was used for data work 
## and python for the animation. 

## data set can be obtained here: http://cdn.gea.esac.esa.int/Gaia/gedr3/simulation/gaia_universe_model/
